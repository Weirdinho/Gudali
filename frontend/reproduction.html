          <h1>REPRODUCTION PERFORMANCE</h1>
          <div class="body-1-top">
            <div class="body-1-top-left">
              <h1>Importance</h1>
              <p>
                Reproduction is a critical factor in determining profitability
                in a cow/calf enterprise. To maintain a calving interval of 365
                days, a cow must re-breed within 80 to 85 days after calving.
                Poor reproductive performance is directly linked to the
                percentage of body fat in cows, as adequate nutrition is
                essential for the reproductive system to function properly.
                Developing a nutrition program is more manageable and
                cost-effective when all cows on a farm can be managed similarly,
                especially when managed in a single herd, which is common in
                small production units (Babayemi et al., 2014).
              </p>
              <h1>Impact of Calving</h1>
              <p>
                Calving year-round complicates maintaining adequate body
                condition at critical times, leading to several issues:

                <br />
                (1) Reduced income per cow <br />
                (2) Increased post-partum interval <br />
                (3) Weak calves at birth <br />
                (4) Low quality and quantity of colostrum <br />
                (5) Reduced milk production <br />
                (6) Increased dystocia <br />
                (7) Lower weaning weights <br />
                Poor body condition leads to a longer interval from calving to
                first estrus, resulting in younger, smaller calves at weaning
                the following year, reducing income if sold at weaning. Weak
                calves at birth may not get adequate colostrum, making them more
                susceptible to disease, reducing weaning weights, feedlot
                performance, and carcass traits. Cows in moderate body condition
                have a shorter interval from calving to first estrus than those
                in thin condition (Babayemi et al., 2014).
              </p>

              <h1>Culling Practices</h1>
              <p>
                According to Okoli et al. (2012), 90.90% of pastoralists in the
                humid rain-forest of Nigeria allow 6-10 calvings per cow within
                its reproductive life, while 9.10% may allow up to 11-15
                calvings per cow. Most female animals culled for sale are very
                old, as reported in abattoir studies by Okoli et al. (2001).
                Cattle production and breeding efficiency on grazing rangelands
                of Northern Nigeria are low, especially during the dry season
                (Mapiye, Chimonyo, & Dzama, 2009).
              </p>
              <h1>Breeding Bulls</h1>
              <p>
                Bulls in pastoral cattle herds typically reach breeding age at
                4.05 years, likely due to poor nutrition and other environmental
                stressors. Nutrition and feed intake of young bulls affect the
                age at which they reach puberty (Blezinger, 2008). Neumann
                (1990) suggested that bull calves around 15 months of age should
                not run with cows in controlled breeding.

              <h1>Age and Calving Interval</h1>
              <p>
                Age at First Calving: In Northern Nigeria, age at first calving
                exceeds two years (Nqeno, Chimonyo, Mapiye, & Marufu, 2009),
                with an average of 4.75 years reported by Akpa et al. (2012),
                which aligns with data from Bunaji herds on the Jos Plateau
                (Synge, 1980) but higher than the 37-month reported in the
                National Veterinary Research Institute, Vom (Ologun, 1980). This
                variation is mainly due to low feed quality and quantity on
                communal grazing lands, particularly during the dry season
                (Angassa & Oba, 2007; Nqeno et al., 2009). <br />
                <br />
                Steers' Slaughter Weight: Steers reach slaughter weight between
                24 and 30 months of age (du Plessis & Hoffman, 2004). <br />
                <br />
                Off-take Rates: Off-take rates vary between 2 and 10% per annum
                (Mapiye et al., 2009).
              </p>
              <h1>Nutritional Recommendations</h1>
              <p>
                Providing feed supplements could improve cattle production, but
                it is crucial to identify the types of nutrients limiting
                production in a given zone (Ndlovu, Chimonyo, & Muchenje, 2009).
              </p>

                Comparison of Research Institutions and Traditional Systems
              </h1>
              <p>
                Standard technical coefficients compare research institutions
                like the National Animal Production Research Institute, Zaria,
                or the National Veterinary Research Institute, Vom, with the
                traditional system in Nigeria (Mbap, 1996). Key metrics include:
                <br />

                (1) Calving rate <br />
                (2) Calving cycle <br />
                (3) Age at first calving <br />
                (4) Length of lactation <br />
                (5) Productive life <br />
                (6) Milk to butter ratio <br />
              </p>
              <h1>Calving cycle</h1>

              <p>
                Research institutions reported: <br />
                (1) 13 months (9 months pregnancy + 3 months resting period)
                <br />
                (2) Age at first calving: 38 months <br />
                (3) Length of lactation: 280-300 days <br />
                (4) Productive life: 10 years (5-6 lactations + 4 years before
                lactation) <br />
                (5) Milk to butter ratio: 1 litre to 100 gm <br />
                In comparison, the traditional system in Nigeria shows: <br />

                (1) Calving cycle: 29 to 43 months <br />
                (2) Age at first calving: 30 to 42 months <br />
                (3) Productive life: 9 to 14 years (Mbap, 1996) <br />
