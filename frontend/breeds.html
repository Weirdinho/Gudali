          <h3>Herd Size</h3>
          <p>
            Optimum herd size for an area and for a population can only be
            estimated after many variables have been considered. A theoretical
            concept of optimum herd size takes account of the prevailing
            environmental conditions, biological capacity (performance) of the
            species, herd management practice, and resource use and
            distribution. For the pastoral Fulani of Northern Nigeria, none of
            these factors are static; therefore, optimum herd size is dynamic,
            varying by a wide margin, depending on the circumstance of the
            individual pastoralist...

          <h3>Reproduction Performance</h3>
          <p>
            Reproduction is the most important factor in determining
            profitability in a cow/calf enterprise. To maintain a calving
            interval of 365 days, a cow must re-breed in 80 to 85 days after
            calving. Poor reproductive performance is directly linked to the
            percentage of body fat in cows. Researchers have determined that, a
            certain amount of body fat is required for the reproductive system
            to function, since inadequate nutrition is most often the cause of
            poor reproductive performance...

          <h3>Productivity</h3>
          <p>
            Protein, energy and minerals are the most critical nutrients
            affecting milk and beef production in the semi-arid areas. Some
            reports have suggested that, energy and minerals are not limiting
            nutrients to grazing cattle, but attributed losses in cattle
            productivity to deficiencies in protein. However, reported that,
            during the early to mid-wet season, rangelands are not adequate
            sources of energy and minerals. This results in low cattle growth
            rates during this period and stands as a major constraint to
            increasing body weight gains and consequently affecting beef
            production in the semi-arid areas...

          <h3>Economic</h3>
          <p>
            Nigeria is one of the leading countries in cattle production in
            sub-Saharan Africa. For example, in 2018, it was reported that, the
            country had over 14.73 million cattle consisting of1.47 million
            milking cows and 13.26 million beef cattle. Less than 1% of this
            population is managed commercially, while about 99% is managed
            traditionally Cattle singly contribute about 12.7% of the
            agricultural Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Nigeria (CBN, 1999).
            The cattle industry provides a means of livelihood for a significant
            proportion of pastoral households and participants in the cattle
            value chain in the sub-humid and semi-arid ecological zones of
            Nigeria... <span><a href="/economic">Read more</a></span>

            <h3>Cultural</h3>
            <p>
              Other cultural and economic contributions of cattle include the
              prestige inherent in their ownership and their place in custom,
              religion and festive occasions. Recently, cattle have been used as
              experimental animals such that much of what is known today about
              milk fat synthesis and the physiological mechanism that is
              involved, relate to the ruminant on account of its convenience in
              research. Cattle, also, assist in the economic utilization of
              non-marketable crop resources, adding to them. These animals are
              able to survive on fallow lands and others that are not good for
              arable crop farming, thereby maximizing the use of the available
              land resource...
